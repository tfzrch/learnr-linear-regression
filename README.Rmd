```{r packages-bib}

)
```

## Purpose

This is a work-in-progress project to create an interactive tutorial on Linear
Regression, focussing (mostly) on concepts rather than code, and taking a highly
visual approach to showing how Linear Regression works.

```{r linear-regression-gif, out.width='55%', fig.align='center'}
gif <- "linear-regression-anim-001.gif"
gif <- here("Rmd", "linear-regression", "images", gif)
knitr::include_graphics(gif)
```

## Acknowledgements

This project depends heavily on the Palmer Penguins dataset [@R-palmerpenguins]
and the tidyverse suite [@R-tidyverse]. The tutorial is built with learnr 
[@R-learnr] and animated visuals are built with gganimate [@R-gganimate].
