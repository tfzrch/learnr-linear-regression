## Linear Regression - What is it for?

Linear Regression is designed to predict the value of a numerical variable,
using a predictor variable, which also needs to be numeric. In most cases,
both will be continuous data.

To start, let's think about how we'd visualise this problem.

```{r linear-reg-scatter-quiz}
lr_scatter_quiz_question <- c(
  "Which type of plot is the most appropriate for showing the",
  "relationship between two continous variables?"
)

quiz(
  question(
    paste(lr_scatter_quiz_question),
    answer("Bar plot"),
    answer("Histogram"),
    answer("Radial plot"),
    answer("Scatter plot", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
